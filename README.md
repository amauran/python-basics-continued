# Python Basics

Welcome to the Python Basics, where we install Linux in top of Windows for learning some basic python coding.

Note: this is a fork of [our original project](https://github.com/talamus/python-basics) which we started a few years back.

### Start by reading [the wiki!](https://github.com/amauran/python-basics-continued/wiki)

Then continue by examining the `adventure` code... 😉
